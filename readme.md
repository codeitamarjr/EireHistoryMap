# Éire Historical Map

This project is based on [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) using React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/drawer-navigator),[Vector Icons](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons),[React Native Maps](https://github.com/react-native-maps/react-native-maps), to build an app that shows the historical maps of Ireland.

The markers are clickable and show the name of the marker, along with the location.
This dataset is from [Macmorris](https://macmorris.maynoothuniversity.ie/). MACMORRIS sets out to recover the vibrancy and complexity of Ireland’s transformative years between Henry VIII’s assumption of the kingship of Ireland in 1541 and the Treaty of Limerick in 1691. The project is a collaboration between the Department of History at Maynooth University and the Department of History at the University of Limerick.
