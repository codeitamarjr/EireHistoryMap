This project is based on [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) using:

- [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/drawer-navigator),[Vector Icons](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons),[React Naive Maps](https://github.com/react-native-maps/react-native-maps)

Special thank you to Adrian Twarog for his help with Youtube videos:

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJX8plp4_sc That helped me to understand how to use React Navigation.
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qq0GQPkfjI&t=1010s That helped me to understand how to use React Native Maps.
